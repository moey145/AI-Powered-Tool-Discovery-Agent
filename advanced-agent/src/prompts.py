        - integration_capabilities: List of tools/platforms it integrates with (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, Docker, AWS, etc.)

        IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to pricing and licensing information. Look for:
        - Free/open source indicators: "free", "open source", "MIT license", "Apache license", "GPL", "community edition"
        - Freemium indicators: "free tier", "trial", "demo", "basic plan", "premium features", "upgrade"
        - Paid indicators: "subscription", "pricing", "cost", "license fee", "commercial license", "paid", "premium", "pro", "enterprise", "business", "professional"
        - Enterprise indicators: "enterprise", "business", "professional", "commercial", "paid plans", "subscription required"
        
        CRITICAL PRICING DETECTION RULES:
        - If the tool name contains "Pro", "Enterprise", "Business", "Premium" → likely "Paid" or "Enterprise"

        - If the tool is a commercial testing platform → likely "Paid"
        - If the tool is open source but has commercial support → likely "Freemium"
        - If the tool is completely free with no paid tiers → "Free"

        Focus on developer-relevant features like APIs, SDKs, language support, integrations, and development workflows.
